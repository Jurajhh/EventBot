# EventBot
*Facebook Messenger bot* to enhance the flow of your event.

After having created a profile of your bot on facebook,
just enter the login details, i.e. email and password into the file **EventBotInAction.py**:

    try:
        client = EventBot("email", "password") # add email and password
                                               # of your fb Messenger bot

The bot has a default behaviour and is easy to customize.
